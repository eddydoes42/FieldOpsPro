## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side is built with React and TypeScript, using a component-based architecture with shadcn/ui for consistent UI. wouter is used for routing and TanStack Query for server state management. The frontend is organized into distinct role-based dashboard views with shared components.

### Backend Architecture
The server uses Express.js with TypeScript, following a RESTful API design. It includes modules for authentication, data operations, and route handling, implementing role-based access control and comprehensive error handling.

### Database Design
PostgreSQL is the primary database, with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. The schema includes tables for users, work orders, tasks, time entries, messages, and sessions, supporting hierarchical user roles and task management with referential integrity.

### Authentication & Authorization
Authentication uses Replit's OAuth with session management via connect-pg-simple. Role-based authorization is implemented for administrators, managers, field agents, and clients, with strict access controls and administrator-only user creation. Users can have multiple roles simultaneously.

### State Management
Frontend uses TanStack Query for server state management. Form state is managed with React Hook Form and Zod for validation, sharing schemas between frontend and backend.

### UI/UX Design
The application features a modern design built on Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, providing a responsive interface. It emphasizes role-specific workflows with distinct dashboard layouts and a consistent dark theme using a blue-grey color scheme. A comprehensive calendar system with weekly view and advanced filtering is integrated.
