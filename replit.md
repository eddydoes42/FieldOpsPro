## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side is built with React and TypeScript, using a component-based architecture with shadcn/ui for consistent UI. wouter is used for routing and TanStack Query for server state management. The frontend is organized into distinct role-based dashboard views with shared components.

### Backend Architecture
The server uses Express.js with TypeScript, following a RESTful API design. It includes modules for authentication, data operations, and route handling, implementing role-based access control and comprehensive error handling.

### Database Design
PostgreSQL is the primary database, with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. The schema includes tables for users, work orders, tasks, time entries, messages, and sessions, supporting hierarchical user roles and task management with referential integrity.

### Authentication & Authorization
Authentication uses Replit's OAuth with session management via connect-pg-simple. The system implements a strict hierarchical role-based authorization system:

**Operations Director (God Mode):**
- Complete system oversight and control
- Only role that can create/delete service companies, clients, and administrators
- Can perform any function across all service companies
- Role Testing: When using Role Tester (white bar), restricted to selected role's capabilities
- Not associated with any service company
- Oversees unresolved issues and app functionality

**Service Company Hierarchy (within each service company):**
1. **Administrator**: User account creation/editing/deletion; work order CRUD and assignment; Job Network access; issue resolution; user suspension/deactivation; messaging
2. **Manager**: Same as Administrator, EXCEPT Administrator can delete Manager but not vice versa
3. **Dispatcher**: Same as Manager, EXCEPT cannot create/delete/edit user accounts
4. **Field Agent**: View/complete assigned work orders only; message team members; edit own contact info; access /mywork dashboard

**Test Service Company Structure:**
- Test Service Company exists with full team for role testing
- Test Admin, Test Manager, Test Dispatcher, Test Field Agent users

### State Management
Frontend uses TanStack Query for server state management. Form state is managed with React Hook Form and Zod for validation, sharing schemas between frontend and backend.

### UI/UX Design
The application features a modern design built on Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, providing a responsive interface. It emphasizes role-specific workflows with distinct dashboard layouts and a consistent dark theme using a blue-grey color scheme. A comprehensive calendar system with weekly view and advanced filtering is integrated.
