IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT — “Stash‑Style Layout, FieldOps DNA, Poppins Font, Full Feature Preservation”

OBJECTIVE:
Refactor the frontend UI to adopt the structural layout patterns of Stash (search bar prominence, card grid layout, bottom navigation bar, consistent spacing/alignment) while retaining all FieldOps Pro core design DNA — including color palette, typography hierarchy (updated to Poppins), iconography, and all existing business logic. 
All current navigation menus, dashboard cards, and data displays must be carried over exactly as they are now — no loss of features, routes, or role‑specific content.

---

1. PRESERVE CORE DNA
- Keep all existing color variables, brand imagery, and typography hierarchy (only change font family to Poppins).
- Maintain all current functionality — no changes to:
  - Issue creation workflows
  - Heartbeat monitor logic
  - Authentication and RBAC
  - API calls and data handling
- Do not rename or remove existing component props, state variables, or event handlers.

2. FONT UPDATE
- Apply Poppins globally via theme or global CSS.
- Maintain existing font sizes, weights, and hierarchy.
- Ensure efficient loading (Google Fonts or local hosting).

3. STASH‑LIKE STRUCTURE
- Search Bar:
  - Prominent placement at top of relevant screens.
  - Rounded container, left‑aligned search icon, placeholder text, clear (“X”) button.
  - Keep existing search logic intact.
- Card Layout:
  - Uniform card sizes, consistent padding, subtle shadows.
  - Image/icon at top, title/subtitle below, actions at bottom.
  - Responsive grid/flex layout.
  - All existing cards and their data sources must be preserved exactly as they are now.
- Spacing & Alignment:
  - Consistent margins/padding between sections.
  - Use grid/flexbox for alignment.

4. ROLE‑AWARE BOTTOM NAVIGATION
- Bottom navigation bar must reflect the current role’s existing navigation menu.
- Pull menu items from the same source/config used for the current top/side navigation for that role.
- Maintain all existing routes and permissions.
- On mobile/tablet: fixed to bottom, touch‑friendly hit areas.
- On desktop: hidden (retain current desktop navigation pattern).

5. ROLE‑AWARE HEARTBEAT MONITOR
- Admin Team Dashboards: Show “Company Heartbeat” — average heartbeat across all active projects in that company.
- Operations Director Dashboard: Show “Global Heartbeat” — average heartbeat across all active projects for all companies.
- Appear only on these dashboards; hidden elsewhere.
- Keep heartbeat calculation logic intact; only scope and display rules change.
- Thin horizontal bar below search bar, Poppins font, brand accent background.

6. DASHBOARD & DATA DISPLAY PRESERVATION
- All dashboards must display the same data, cards, and KPIs they do now.
- Card layouts may be restyled to match the new card component, but data sources, queries, and logic must remain unchanged.
- Preserve all role‑specific sections, including but not limited to:
  - “The Things to Approve” for Dispatcher and above
  - Any KPI summaries, alerts, or widgets currently visible per role
- No loss of existing filters, sorting, or pagination.

7. NAVIGATION INTEGRITY
- All existing page navigations must remain intact.
- All routes, deep links, and role‑based access rules must function exactly as before.
- No changes to route names, parameters, or guards.

8. COMPONENTIZATION
- Create reusable components:
  - <SearchBar> — accepts value, onChange, onClear.
  - <Card> — accepts image, title, subtitle, actions.
  - <BottomNav> — accepts array of { icon, label, route } from role‑specific menu config.
  - <HeartbeatBar> — accepts label, percentage, projectCount.
- Replace existing inline UI with these components where applicable.

9. STYLING APPROACH
- Use existing CSS variables/theme tokens for colors.
- Apply new layout styles via CSS Modules, Tailwind, or styled‑components (consistent with current stack).
- Avoid global overrides that could affect unrelated components.

10. RESPONSIVENESS
- Bottom nav: mobile/tablet only.
- Search bar and cards: fluid scaling with viewport width.
- Test breakpoints: mobile portrait, mobile landscape, tablet, desktop.

11. TESTING & VERIFICATION
- Verify:
  - All features still function.
  - Dashboards show correct data/cards.
  - Navigation menus match role permissions.
  - No console errors/warnings.
  - Layout matches Stash’s structure but retains FieldOps Pro’s look.
  - Poppins font applied consistently.
- Cross‑browser test: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
