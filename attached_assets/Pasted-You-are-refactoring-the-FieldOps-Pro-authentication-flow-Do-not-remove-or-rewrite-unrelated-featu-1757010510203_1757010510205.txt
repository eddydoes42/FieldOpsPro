You are refactoring the FieldOps Pro authentication flow.  
Do not remove or rewrite unrelated features, constants, or styles.  
Preserve all existing login logic, error handling, and UI patterns unless explicitly changed below.

## Goals:
1. **Biometric Authentication (Refactor & Fix)**
   - Analyze existing biometric authentication code (Touch ID, Face ID, or platform equivalent) for flaws, logic errors, or incorrect API usage.
   - Identify and fix issues preventing biometric login from functioning as intended.
   - Ensure biometric login is only offered if the device supports it and the user has enabled it.
   - Confirm that on successful biometric authentication, the login flow proceeds using stored credentials (from "Remember This Device" cache if available).
   - Maintain fallback to manual username/password login if biometric authentication fails or is canceled.

2. **"Remember This Device" Autofill (Refactor & Fix)**
   - Analyze existing "Remember This Device" implementation to determine why cached credentials are not autofilling.
   - Fix so that when "Remember This Device" is selected:
     - Credentials (username/email and securely stored password token) are cached securely (Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android, secure local storage on web/desktop).
     - On subsequent app launches, if cache exists and is valid, autofill the login form fields with the stored credentials.
     - If biometric authentication is available and enabled, allow direct login without showing the login form.
   - Ensure secure storage best practices â€” never store plain text passwords.

3. **General Requirements**
   - Keep all changes modular and isolated to authentication-related files/components.
   - Maintain cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, desktop/web).
   - Use existing UI components and styling for any biometric login prompts or autofill indicators.
   - Add or update inline comments explaining fixes and platform-specific handling.
   - Ensure all new and refactored code paths are covered by existing or new unit tests.

## Deliverables:
- Refactored biometric authentication logic that works as intended on all supported platforms.
- Fixed "Remember This Device" logic so credentials autofill correctly and integrate with biometric login.
- Clear, commented code changes that explain what was fixed and why.
- No regressions in existing authentication or navigation flows.

Do not alter unrelated business logic, navigation, or styling outside the authentication context.
