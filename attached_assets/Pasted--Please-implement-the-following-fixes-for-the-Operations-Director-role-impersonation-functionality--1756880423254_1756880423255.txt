"Please implement the following fixes for the Operations Director role impersonation functionality:

Review Role Testing Initialization:

Ensure the handleStartTesting function in the role-tester component properly initializes and passes the selected role and company type for role impersonation.
Update startImpersonation Method:

In RoleImpersonationService, modify the startImpersonation method to ensure it verifies the original user's role as operations_director. If valid, proceed to fetch the test user based on the selected role and company type.
Ensure proper error handling if the test company or user is not found to return an informative message.
Correct Redirect Logic:

After impersonation is started successfully, use the returned redirectUrl from startImpersonation to navigate to the appropriate dashboard for the impersonated role.
Here is a sample code snippet for handleStartTesting to guide you:

const handleStartTesting = () => {
  if (!selectedRole || !selectedCompanyType) {
    toast({
      title: "Selection Required",
      description: "Please select both a company type and role to test",
      variant: "destructive",
    });
    return;
  }
  startImpersonationMutation.mutate(
    {
      role: selectedRole,
      companyType: selectedCompanyType,
    },
    {
      onSuccess: (data) => {
        // Set the role testing info in local storage
        localStorage.setItem('testingRole', selectedRole);
        localStorage.setItem('testingCompanyType', selectedCompanyType);
        // Redirect to the appropriate dashboard for the selected role
        window.location.href = `/${data.context.role}-dashboard`; // Adjust based on your routing structure
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        toast({
          title: "Error Starting Role Testing",
          description: error.message || "Failed to start role testing.",
          variant: "destructive",
        });
      },
    }
  );
};
After these changes, please test the flow to verify that the Operations Director can successfully access the dashboards of the impersonated user."
