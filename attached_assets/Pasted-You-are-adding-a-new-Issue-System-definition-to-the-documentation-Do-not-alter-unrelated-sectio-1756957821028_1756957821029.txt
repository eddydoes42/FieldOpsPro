## Issue System — Definition & Rules

The Issue System is designed with inspiration from Field Nation’s “Report a Problem” and “Case Creation” workflows, adapted for FieldOps Pro’s operational model.

### Escalation Levels
There are four escalation levels, from lowest to highest:
1. **Low**
2. **Medium**
3. **High**
4. **Urgent**

### Issue Creation Rules
- **Service Company & Client Company**
  - Any user with **Dispatcher** rank and above can create an issue **without approval**.
  - **Field Engineers** and **Field Agents** require approval from a **Dispatcher** or above to create an issue.

### Resolution Responsibility
- Issues must be resolved by the **appropriate member on the opposite company** associated with the work order or project.
  - Example: If a Service Company creates a Medium-level issue, it must be resolved by a **Client Company** (that posted the work order or project) **Manager** or above.

### Resolution Authority by Role
- **Administrator**
  - Must resolve issues with **High** escalation level and above.
  - Can resolve High and Urgent issues without additional approval.
- **Project Manager**
  - Can resolve High and Urgent issues **only with Administrator approval**.
  - Can resolve Medium and Low issues without approval.
- **Manager**
  - Can resolve **Medium** and **Low** issues.
  - Requires **Project Manager approval** to resolve Medium issues.
- **Dispatcher and Below**
  - Can only resolve **Low** escalation issues.
- **Field Engineers & Field Agents**
  - Cannot resolve issues above Low escalation level.
  - Require approval for any Issue CRUD.
