Objective:
Refine the existing Project Heartbeat Monitor UI to improve clarity and visual appeal without altering its data source, refresh logic, backend integration, or role-based visibility rules. The updated design should display only the heartbeat (BPM) data and category, styled in a clean, minimal format, and use an EKG-style waveform for visual representation.

Critical Safeguard:
- Do NOT modify how or where the heartbeat data is pulled.
- Do NOT change refresh intervals, data processing, or backend endpoints.
- Do NOT alter any existing logic that determines which data is shown to which roles.
- All changes must be purely presentational.

Requirements:

1. Data Display:
   - Show only:
       • Heartbeat value (BPM)
       • Category/status label (e.g., Normal, At Risk, Delayed)
   - Remove BrPM, SO, or any other unrelated metrics from the UI.

2. Waveform Design:
   - Replace the current waveform with a clean, continuous EKG-style trace similar to the provided reference.
   - Use smooth P wave → QRS spike → T wave shapes for each beat.
   - Sync waveform spikes to the actual BPM timing from the existing data feed.
   - Ensure the waveform scrolls horizontally in real time.

3. Styling:
   - Match the minimal UI style shown in the provided reference:
       • Poppins font
       • Consistent spacing and alignment
       • Subdued background with high-contrast text
   - Use status-based waveform colors:
       • Green = Normal
       • Yellow = At Risk
       • Red = Delayed
   - Keep the background clean and uncluttered.

4. Layout:
   - Position BPM value prominently, with category label directly below or beside it.
   - Place the waveform directly adjacent or beneath the BPM display for immediate correlation.
   - Ensure responsive scaling for desktop and mobile.

5. Performance:
   - Optimize waveform rendering (Canvas or SVG) for smooth animation without frame drops.
   - Ensure multiple heartbeat monitors can run simultaneously without performance degradation.

6. Testing:
   - Verify BPM value matches the incoming data feed exactly.
   - Confirm waveform spikes align with BPM timing.
   - Test all status colors and category labels.
   - Check responsiveness and readability on various screen sizes.

Deliverable:
An updated Heartbeat Monitor UI that retains all existing functionality and data handling, but presents only BPM and category in a clean, minimal style with a smooth, real-time EKG waveform, improving readability and visual clarity.
