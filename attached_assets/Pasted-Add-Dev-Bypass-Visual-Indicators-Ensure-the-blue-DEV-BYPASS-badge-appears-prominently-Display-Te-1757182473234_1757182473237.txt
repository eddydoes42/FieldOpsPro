Add Dev Bypass Visual Indicators: Ensure the blue "DEV BYPASS" badge appears prominently
Display Testing Goals: Make sure the comprehensive testing goals text is visible in the approval card
Enhanced Card Styling: Apply blue border and background to clearly distinguish dev bypass requests
Phase 2: Fix Approval Logic Flow
Bypass User Creation Form: Modify the click handler to skip the user form for dev bypass requests
Direct API Call: Route dev bypass approvals directly to the review endpoint with 'approved' status
Immediate Company/User Creation: Ensure the server-side logic creates the company and user automatically upon approval
Phase 3: Backend Logic Verification
Review Server Handler: Confirm the /api/access-requests/:id/review endpoint properly handles dev bypass approval
Company Creation Logic: Verify the handleDevBypassApproval function creates both company and admin user
Credential Activation: Ensure created credentials are immediately valid for login
Phase 4: Testing & Validation
End-to-End Test: Verify complete flow from request submission to successful login
Database Verification: Confirm company and user records are created properly
Access Validation: Test that created credentials work immediately after approval
Root Cause Analysis
The core issue appears to be that the frontend conditional logic isn't properly detecting request.isDevBypass or the button click is still routing to the regular approval flow instead of the direct approval mutation I created.

Immediate Fix Strategy
Debug Data Flow: Check if isDevBypass field is properly reaching the frontend
Fix Button Logic: Ensure the button correctly calls directApproveMutation for dev bypass requests
Verify API Response: Confirm the testing goals and dev bypass flags are in the API response
Test Complete Flow: Validate that approval creates company/user and enables immediate login
This plan will ensure that clicking the green checkmark on a Dev Bypass request immediately:

✅ Shows "Dev Access Approved!" success message
✅ Creates the TEST company automatically
✅ Creates the administrator user with provided credentials
✅ Makes credentials valid for immediate login and testing
