Proceed with full FieldOps Pro implementation per the Master 13‑Module All‑in‑One plan, including the Project Heartbeat Monitor and Document Uploading Feature. Follow the build order and dependencies below. Implement backend and frontend builds in parallel where APIs are stable. Maintain existing design/structure, role-based access, and backward compatibility. Use feature flags for staged rollout.

PHASE 1 — Independent Foundations (parallelizable):
1. M1 — Job Request System
2. M2 — Contractor Onboarding Flow
3. M4 — Role‑Aware Messaging Hub
4. M6 — Audit Trail System
5. M11 — Job Category Profitability & Efficiency Analysis
6. M12 — Enhanced Work Order Search & Filters
7. M14 — Bid & Proposal System
8. M15 — Credential & Compliance Vault

PHASE 2 — Dependent Enhancements (sequential where noted):
1. M3 — Job Visibility Logic (depends on M2)
2. M5 — Issue Creation System (benefits from M4)
3. NEW MODULE — Project Heartbeat Monitor (after M5, before M7):
   - Project Detail page only; literal EKG animation with color cues (Green ≤90 BPM, Yellow 91–130, Orange 131–170, Red 171–179, Flatline ≥180).
   - Baseline: 70 BPM; Failure: 180 BPM.
   - Escalations: Issue Created +10, Missed Check‑In +15, Unresolved Issue ≥1h +5 (+5 every 12h), Denied Deliverable +10, Over Budget +10, Uncompleted Tasks on Complete +5.
   - Positives: Issue Resolved −10, On‑Time Check‑In −10, Approved Deliverables −10, All Tasks Completed −5 (50% effect if multiple escalations active).
   - On failure: mark project failed; auto‑review Service Company members (default 3★, configurable by Client Company Admin). Client Company not auto‑reviewed; if at fault, cap rating at 4★.
   - Event triggers from Issue Creation, Check‑In, Deliverable workflow, Budget tracking, Task completion.
   - Purely visual; BPM state in memory; optional `project_health_log` table.
4. NEW MODULE — Document Uploading Feature (after Heartbeat Monitor, before M7):
   - Add "Upload Documents" button to Project and Work Order creation forms.
   - On click: upload one or more files (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, JPG, PNG).
   - Categorize by timing: Pre‑visit, During visit, Post‑visit.
   - Integrate with existing "number of required documents" field in Project creation.
   - Allow Work Order assignees to upload documents at the task level; visible in task detail view.
   - Store metadata: id, linked entity (project/work order/task), category, file_url, uploaded_by, uploaded_at.
   - Role‑based access: creators + assigned agents can upload; view follows existing visibility rules.
   - Frontend: file picker, list of uploaded docs with filename, category, uploader, timestamp; allow deletion by uploader/admin before completion.
   - Backend: `documents` table; API POST /api/documents, GET /api/documents?entityType=...&entityId=..., DELETE /api/documents/:id.
5. M7 — Client Feedback Loop
6. M8 — Agent Performance Analytics (needs M6, M5, M7)
7. M9 — Service Quality Dashboard (needs M8)
8. M10 — Predictive Risk & Early Intervention (needs M9)
9. M13 — Smart Match / Recommended Assignments (needs M11, M12)
10. M16 — Incentive & Recognition Engine (needs M8, M7)
