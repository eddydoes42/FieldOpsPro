Configure the existing Replit AgentConnect project Field Ops Pro to support and enforce the following roles, hierarchies, permissions, dashboards, and workflows without disrupting what’s already in place:

1. Roles and Hierarchy  
   • Operations Director (Ops Dir): superuser and lead developer, not tied to any company  
     – Full access to create, implement, or remove features, roles, and functions  
     – Two built-in Role Testers (SC Role Tester & CC Role Tester) that switch the Ops Dir into a Test<Role> dashboard (e.g., “Test Field Agent”) under Test Service Company or Test Client Company  
     – Defaults to Ops Dir view if no tester is selected  
     – Duties: role testing, functionality testing, onboarding/deleting companies & admins, granting access, approving manager deletions, app monitoring, issue creation/resolution/deletion  

   • Test Companies  
     – Test Service Company & Test Client Company, each with one Test<Role> user per role  

2. Service Company Roles & Permissions  
   • Admin  
     – Highest rank; only Ops Dir can delete  
     – Manage users (create/edit/delete/deactivate), projects, work orders, and issues  
     – Sole role that can message Ops Dir  
     – Approve manager deletions  
   • Project Manager  
     – Same as Admin except cannot delete Admin  
     – Full project lifecycle (create/edit/assign/approve/delete), budget management, user management, issue handling  
   • Manager  
     – Same as Admin except cannot delete Admin or Project Manager  
     – Full work-order lifecycle, user management, project assignment/completion, issue handling  
   • Dispatcher  
     – Same as Admin except cannot delete Admin, PM, or Manager  
     – Handle assignments, completions, approvals, deletions, and issues  
   • Field Agent / Field Engineer  
     – View and complete only assigned work orders; message non-admin users  
     – Upon promotion to Field Engineer, self-assign work orders and view budgets  

3. Client Company Roles & Permissions  
   • Mirror Service Company hierarchy minus Field Agent/Engineer  
   • Create and route work orders/projects; approve or deny requests and counteroffers  

4. Networks & Workflows  
   • Job Network: client work orders + a service company’s internal orders; service companies request/counteroffer; client approves; admin team assigns to agents  
   • Project Network: project requests/counteroffers; approved projects allow internal work orders that deduct from the project budget; client final approval calculates profit  
   • Talent Network: company cards list onboarded users; visibility determined by role hierarchy  
   • Exclusive Networks: client admins add service companies post-completion; exclusive alerts surface at top for related work orders/projects  

Make sure these configurations and permission checks slot into the existing code and UI flows without undoing or radically altering current features.```
