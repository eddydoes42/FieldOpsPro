## Module: Predictive Risk & Early Intervention (FieldOps Pro Enhancement)

### Objective:
Analyze trends in operational, service quality, and compliance data to identify agents, companies, or job categories at risk of underperformance, and trigger early intervention workflows.

---

### Data Inputs:
- Historical performance snapshots (from Agent Performance Analytics)
- Service Quality Dashboard metrics
- Client feedback trends over time
- Issue Creation module frequency & resolution delays
- Audit trail compliance percentages
- Timeliness metrics

---

### Affected Roles:
- Operations Director (full predictive view + intervention tools)
- Service Company Admin (alerts on their team)
- Client Company Admin (optional alerts for their contracted providers)

---

### Affected Pages:
- `/admin-dashboard/risk-monitor`
- `/service-company-dashboard/risk-alerts`

---

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Trend Analysis**
   - On data update (daily or near‑real‑time), calculate:
     - Rolling 2‑week average ratings per agent/company
     - Change in on‑time % vs. prior period
     - Increase in issue rate vs. baseline
   - Flag entities with ≥15% negative shift in any key metric

2. **Risk Scoring**
   - Combine metrics into a single risk score (0–100)
     - Weight factors (e.g., client satisfaction 40%, issue rate 30%, timeliness 20%, compliance 10%)
   - Store current and historical risk scores for trend lines

3. **Alerting**
   - If risk score exceeds threshold (e.g., >70), push alert to relevant admin dashboard
   - Email/SMS notifications (optional) to Operations Director for critical cases

4. **Intervention Actions**
   - Assign follow‑up tasks: coaching sessions, job shadowing, workflow audit
   - Record interventions in a `risk_interventions` table for accountability

5. **Database Schema**
   - `risk_scores` table:
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     entity_type ENUM('agent','company'),
     entity_id UUID,
     score INT,
     period_start DATE,
     period_end DATE,
     flagged_metrics JSONB,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()

   - `risk_interventions` table:
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     risk_id INT REFERENCES risk_scores(id),
     action TEXT,
     assigned_to UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     status ENUM('open','in_progress','closed'),
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()

6. **Visualization**
   - Heatmap of at‑risk entities
   - Drill‑down to see flagged metrics and recommended interventions
   - Trend lines showing before/after intervention effects

### Notes:
- Module does **not** require changes to existing core workflows — it layers predictive logic atop existing data streams.
- Can later integrate with machine learning for more sophisticated anomaly detection.
- Supports building a culture of *proactive* service quality management.
