- M8 Agent Performance Analytics → needs M6 (Audit Trail), M5 (Issues), M7 (Feedback)
- M9 Service Quality Dashboard → needs M8 (Analytics)
- M10 Predictive Risk & Early Intervention → needs M9 (Service Quality Dashboard)
- M13 Smart Match → depends on M11 (Profitability) + M12 (Enhanced Search)
- M16 Incentive & Recognition Engine → depends on M8 (Analytics) + M7 (Feedback)

### General Implementation Notes:
- Maintain FieldOps Pro’s existing UI/UX style and role-based access controls.
- All modules should be implemented as discrete, testable components.
- Use feature flags for staged rollout.
- Ensure new database tables and fields have proper indexing and foreign keys.
- Preserve backward compatibility with existing APIs and data.
