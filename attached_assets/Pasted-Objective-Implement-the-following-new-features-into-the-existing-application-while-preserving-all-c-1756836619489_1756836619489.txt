Objective:
Implement the following new features into the existing application while preserving all current functionality, data flows, and integrations. Conduct a full audit to identify and fix any potential issues that could impact stability, performance, or user experience. All changes must be backward-compatible and must not disrupt existing workflows.

Critical Safeguards:
- Do NOT remove or alter existing working features unless explicitly required for compatibility.
- Maintain all current data sources, refresh logic, and backend integrations unless a bug fix is necessary.
- Ensure all new features follow the existing role-based permissions and security model.

---

Feature 1 — Biometric Login (for applicable devices/users):
- Implement biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition, or platform equivalent) for supported devices.
- Integrate with existing login/session management so biometrics supplement, not replace, username/password.
- Allow users to enable/disable biometric login in their account settings.
- Ensure fallback to standard login if biometric authentication fails or is unavailable.
- Follow platform-specific best practices (e.g., BiometricPrompt API for Android, Face ID/Touch ID for iOS, Windows Hello for desktop).

Feature 2 — Payment Service & Information Handling:
- Administrators can set up payment information for their company.
- Individual users can set up their own preferred payment method.
- Payment flow:
    1. Client Company pays for a completed and approved work order/project.
    2. Payment appears in the Service Company Administrator’s “Approved Payments” section (accessible via bottom navigation).
    3. Administrator selects recipient user and amount to send.
    4. Funds sent to user’s “Approved Payments” section; remaining funds stay with Administrator for withdrawal or reallocation.
    5. Users can withdraw funds to their preferred payment method.
- Ensure secure storage and handling of payment data (PCI compliance where applicable).
- Maintain full transaction history and audit logs.

Feature 3 — Expense Orders & Reporting:
- Expense Orders can be created within a work order or project by either the Client or Service Company associated with it.
- Fields: Expense type (materials, tools, travel, scope change), date, amount, who covers cost (Client or Service).
- Budget adjustments:
    • If Client covers: add amount to budget; “Withdraw Early” subtracts that amount and sends it to assigned user’s Approved Payments.
    • If Service covers: budget unchanged unless “Withdraw Early” is used, in which case subtract from budget and send to assigned user’s Approved Payments.
- File uploads: allow attaching receipts, photos, or documents.
- Approval workflow:
    • If created by non-admin: requires approval by Manager+ in same company before appearing on work order/project card.
    • If created by admin: auto-approved.
- Display:
    • Mini-card on work order/project card showing EO label, amount, and payer.
    • Clicking mini-card opens full details + “Withdraw Early” option.
- Expense Reporting:
    • Admin+ dashboard section “Expense Reports” with card linking to /expenses.
    • /expenses shows all expenses with positive/negative annotation (positive = covered by other company, negative = covered by own company).
    • Include overall expense summary (total spent vs. received).

Feature 4 — “Remember Me” / “Remember This Device”:
- Add optional checkbox on login screen to remember device for faster login.
- Store secure token locally (encrypted) to allow bypassing full credential entry on subsequent logins.
- Respect session expiration and allow users to revoke remembered devices from account settings.
- Ensure compatibility with biometric login (if both enabled, biometric prompt can appear without full credential entry).

Full App Functionality Audit & Fixes:
- Review all major workflows (login, navigation, role-based access, data fetching, form submissions, payments, approvals, notifications).
- Identify and fix:
    • Broken or inconsistent UI components.
    • API calls returning errors or inconsistent data.
    • Role-based permission mismatches.
    • Performance bottlenecks in high-traffic areas.
    • Missing/null data handling that could cause crashes.
- Ensure all new features integrate seamlessly with existing navigation, permissions, and data models.
- Run regression tests to confirm no existing features are broken.

---

Testing & Verification:
- Test all new features for all applicable roles (Admin, Manager, Field User, Client, Service).
- Verify payment flows end-to-end with test data.
- Verify expense order creation, approval, budget adjustment, and reporting.
- Test biometric login and “remember me” on supported devices.
- Confirm all security and compliance requirements are met.
- Validate responsiveness and performance on desktop and mobile.

Deliverable:
A fully functional application with biometric login, enhanced payment handling, expense orders/reporting, and “remember me” login, plus a completed functionality audit with all identified issues resolved, ensuring stability, security, and a consistent user experience.
