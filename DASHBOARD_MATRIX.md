## Implementation Requirements

### **Conditional Rendering Logic**
```typescript
// Example for dashboard card visibility
const showCard = (cardPermissions: {resource: string, action: string}) => {
  return hasPermission(user, cardPermissions.resource, cardPermissions.action);
}

// Role-specific dashboard components
const getDashboardCards = (userRole: string, companyType: 'service' | 'client') => {
  // Implementation based on above matrix
}
```

### **Key Fixes Needed**
1. **Unify Administrator Role**: Change `client_company_admin` to `administrator` everywhere
2. **Company Type Context**: Distinguish administrators by company type, not role name
3. **Permission Integration**: Connect RBAC permissions to dashboard card visibility
4. **Role Simulator**: Update to handle unified administrator role
